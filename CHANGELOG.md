## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Signed release: the published package now carries a verified Ed25519
  signature (shared mob first-party key, regenerated in CI on every
  release). Generated apps trust it via `config :mob, :trusted_plugins`,
  so it clears the plugin signature gate without `acknowledge_unsafe_plugins`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

Initial release. QR / barcode scanner for Mob apps.

- `MobScanner.start/2` / `stop/1`. Requires the `mob_camera` plugin for the capture pipeline.
- Extracted from mob core in the 0.7.0 plugin-extraction wave.
- Requires `mob ~> 0.7`.
